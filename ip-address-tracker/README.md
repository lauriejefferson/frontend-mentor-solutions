## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

 I created a Vue project with Vite, and used the Vite import.meta object to store environmental variables.  The Vue 3 Composition API was useful with it's ```ref()``` function that allowed me to keep track of the changes in user input.  CSS Flebox and Grid styling made it easy to switch between desktop and mobile layouts.  LeafletJS was simple to install and add geolocation data from Ipify.


### Continued development

Vue has a simple API and great documentation that allows any developer to get started with making apps.  I will continue to use the Vue 3 Composition API, particularly the Events and Slots features in future projects.
