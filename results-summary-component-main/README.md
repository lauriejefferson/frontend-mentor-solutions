## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used CSS Grid to change the layout from vertical for mobile screens to horizontal for desktop screens. I also used CSS Flexbox to center containers on the screen and to align the content in a column direction.

### Continued development

I use CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid in my projects regularly, so for future projects I'll use more of the shorthand flex properties such as flex and flex-wrap. I would also like to use Container queries, and complex media queries.

### Useful resources
